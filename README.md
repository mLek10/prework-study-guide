# <Emily's Prework Study Guide>

## Description

This project was created to help introduce me to the ins and outs of basic computer coding skills. I was able to learn by doing as opposed to just reading up on the topic, which is my favorite way to learn. This prework study guide will help me continue to learn by doing as I add notes to the webpage, which is also helping me keep all my notes organized in one place. I have learned some basics about HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript through this process while also learning just how challenging this class will be and that I cant lose sight of my end goal, to have a career in computer coding.

## Installation

## Usage

This Prework Study Guide will be used to help me continue to put what I have learned to use. I will also be able to use it as a point of reference for topics including HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. By opening DEV tools in the console I will be able to see JavaScript in action, listing the topics I have learned and choosing one topic to study first.

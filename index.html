    <h2>JavaScript</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>JavaScript is a powerful programming language that can add interactivity to a website.</li>
      <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code</li>
      <li>Control flow is the order in which the computer executes code in a script </li>
      <li>JavaScript is case sensitive</li>
      <li>String-  To signify that the value is a string, enclose it in single or double quote marks.</li>
      <li>Numbers dont have quotes around them</li>
      <li>Boolean- This is a True/False value. The words true and false are special keywords that don't need quote marks.</li>
      <li>Array- This is a structure that allows you to store multiple values in a single reference.</li>
      <li>object- This can be anything. Everything in JavaScript is an object and can be stored in a variable. Keep this in mind as you learn.</li>
      <li>An operator is a mathematical symbol that produces a result based on two values (or variables).</li>
      <li>Conditionals are code structures used to test if an expression returns true or not. A very common form of conditionals is the if...else</li>
